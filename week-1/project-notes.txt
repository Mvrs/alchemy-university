The user experience 

Pass in a signature rather than a wallet address

But, you might feel in the wallet address

We might want to get a public, so they can send some funds, and they control it
because they control the private-key

We can trim the public key to the last 20 bytes similar to ethereum

The idea is to implement signatures (which gives us security)

We need to sign some of intention from the client that will be sent to the server

Once they recover that public key from the client, the server decodes it and validates it based on the public key


1. First thing 
 a. Make input field a wallet address (public key or signature)
  i. signature is more secure, so a website can't get a hold of your private-key
  ii. you're doing the signing outside the client application


2. Add the ability to put a private key as a prop for Wallet Component
3. Transfer Component we eventually take the private key prop to generate a signed transaction 
    so the server can take the signature and derive the address from the person who sent the message

server.js
4. send a sign transaction to the server and server should recover the public key from that signature
  and only allows the transfer to go through if it has a valid public key that actualy has those funds
